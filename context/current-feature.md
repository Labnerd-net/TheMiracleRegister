Added Astro SSR with the Cloudflare Pages adapter to the existing project. Configured astro.config.mjs, wrangler.jsonc, updated tsconfig.json to extend astro/tsconfigs/strict, added dev/build/preview scripts, placeholder index page, and .dev.vars gitignore entry. Build and tests pass.

### Drizzle Schema and Neon Setup
Initialized the full TypeScript project and database layer. Defined all 4 tables (saints, saint_relations, miracles, miracle_sources) split per file, 13 Postgres enums, Drizzle config, Neon client, and migration tooling. Migration applied successfully to Neon dev branch.
